There are 2 Designs :- 1.Dialog Design 2.Window Design 
These 2 Designs can be used to calculate Student Performance in Academics... and Improve your Skils in Programming... 
The QtDialog Design is just a Sample Piece. In this Design you can just Calculate Student Performance and you can save your Data What you have filled in the boxes in your PC
as files mentioned in Saveas FileTypes...
The Wndow Design is a Upgraded Version of the above Design... In this Design we have just converted Dialog Box to a Window and added MenuBar to it and Place Holder Text to it
so it's gonna look more Decorative, etc...
Just Go for a Look... Thank You...
